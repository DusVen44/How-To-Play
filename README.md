How to Play - https://dusven44.github.io/How-To-Play/
A website designed to help users learn how to play their favorite songs on various instruments.

Why?
As a multi-instrument player, I'm always learning songs on every instrument that I play. I wanted a source for links to the sheet music along with lyrics for the artist and song. This app provides all of that.
